# Bold and Italics 

## Bold - to use bold text use two asterisks * symbol  **This is a bold text**
You can also use underscores as well __bold__

## Italics - to use itaclics use a single astericks * symbol *This is italics*
Does this work for italics too? _rad_


If you want to use an astericks in your text then need an escape character first (backslash then asterisks):  \*

If you want to type "\*" on its own, you need to lead it with \\


You can combine italics and bold by using combination of underscores and asterisk:  _**I need caffeine**_
