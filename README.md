# Bold and Italics 

## Bold - to use bold text use two asterisks * symbol  **This is a bold text**
You can also use underscores as well __bold__

## Italics - to use itaclics use a single astericks * symbol *This is italics*
Does this work for italics too? _rad_


If you want to use an astericks in your text then need an escape character first (backslash then asterisks):  \*

If you want to type "\*" on its own, you need to lead it with \\


You can combine italics and bold by using combination of underscores and asterisk:  _**I need caffeine**_

# Quotes and Code Blocks

## Quotes
To add quotes use an arrow sign (greater than) >
> The dishes are done, man

This is a multi-line quote where you have to put a blank spaced line between your lines of text if you dont want it to all end up on the same line together
> Yup its still happening

> and it continues



## Code Blocks

To make a code block in your text, use three backticks (symbol on same key as the tilde): 
```
install_packages("blergh")
```

You can also have does within your text like this with one backtick: `echo hello world`

## Tables

You can make simple tables by using pipe symbol and minus signs: | -

| column 1 | column 2 | column 3|
|:---------|:--------:|--------:|
| item 1   | item 2   | item 3  |
|**bold**  |*italics* | `code`  |

the colon placements align the text within the table boxes for that column
