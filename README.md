normal test 

# Main Header
## Secondary Header
### how many of these is possible?
########## thats ten and its normal text
###### sixth header is the last and it looks grey?


# Bold and Italics 

## Bold - to use bold text use two asterisks * symbol  **This is a bold text**
You can also use underscores as well __bold__

## Italics - to use itaclics use a single astericks * symbol *This is italics*
Does this work for italics too? _rad_


If you want to use an astericks in your text then need an escape character first (backslash then asterisks):  \*

If you want to type "\*" on its own, you need to lead it with \\


You can combine italics and bold by using combination of underscores and asterisk:  _**I need caffeine**_

# Line Ruling

Using minus or underscore signs: at least three minus signs or underscore signs

____

# Quotes and Code Blocks

## Quotes
To add quotes use an arrow sign (greater than) >
> The dishes are done, man

This is a multi-line quote where you have to put a blank spaced line between your lines of text if you dont want it to all end up on the same line together
> Yup its still happening

> and it continues



## Code Blocks

To make a code block in your text, use three backticks (symbol on same key as the tilde): 
```
install_packages("blergh")
```

You can also have does within your text like this with one backtick: `echo hello world`

## Tables

You can make simple tables by using pipe symbol and minus signs: | -

| column 1 | column 2 | column 3|
|:---------|:--------:|--------:|
| item 1   | item 2   | item 3  |
|**bold**  |*italics* | `code`  |
|HUUUUUUGGGEEE THING HERE|  something else  | your mom  |

the colon placements align the text within the table boxes for that column


## Item Lists

### Ordered Lists

1. This is the first thing
1. This is the second thing
1. This is the third thing in a list
This is only useful for when you want to reorder things in  a list and you don't have to renumber anything. so i guess it could be useful for these times


1. Follow this
    1. four spaces for a subset item
1. maybe?


## Unordered Lists
Use an asterisk or minus sign * or - 
* thing 1
* thing 2
- thing 3
but it sees the different symbols as meaning you are starting a new list, so seaparated those out

for sublist add four spaces before the symbol
* Shopping List
    * eggs
    * bacon


## Check List
involves minus, square brackets with a space between the brackets, then space then whatever text you want
 - [ ] pay your rent
 - [ ] call for electrical hookup 
 - [X] eat dinner
